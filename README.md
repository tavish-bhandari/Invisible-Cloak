# Invisible-Cloak
How to create our own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV.

This is a project I made using OpenCV, where I made invisibility T-shirt. This is how I did it.
STEP 1 : Capture the frame
STEP 2 : Convert the frames in HSV format
STEP 3 : Generate the mask for color of T-shirt
STEP 4 : Using bitwise add, create foreground and background
STEP 5 : Add them both and create the final frame and display it

This file displays the final video and also saves it in the same directory with name 'Output.avi'
